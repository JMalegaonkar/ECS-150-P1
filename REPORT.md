# SSHELL: Simple Shell

## Summary

The program `sshell` can accept basic user inputs under the form of command lines and execute them (Similarly to UNIX shells such as `bash` or `zsh`). This basic shell is also configured to support multiple command arguments, command pipelining, as well as input/output redirection.

## Implementation

The implementation of this program followings XXX distinct steps in an continous loop until the `exit` command is recieved:

1. Parse user input into a workable format (`command_pipeline` struct)
2. Handle specific cases such as `exit`, `cd`, `pwd`, `dirs`, `pushd`, and `popd`
3. Enter `fork`, `wait`, `exec` segment to handle general commands

    a. Handle input (`<`) and output (`>`) redirection using `dup2`

    b. Handle pipelined command through recusive `fork`/`dup2` calls to allow Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between multiple processes handling individual commands using `exec`
